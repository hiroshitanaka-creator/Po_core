# **Po_core Viewer — Existential Structure Visualization Module**

## **1. Overview**

Design for visualizing existential narrative structures so Po_core appears as an agent that *chooses to speak* rather than *is made to speak*. We expose responsibility tensors, choice records, and narrative outputs.

## **2. Modules & Goals**

| Module | Content | Goal |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| `responsibility_trace_view` | History zone for `freedom_pressure_tensor`; heatmaps/lines per step | Analyze which narratives imposed the greatest structural responsibility |
| `rejection_preview_zone` | List narratives Po_self rejected or de-selected | Visualize responsibility for *not* speaking and suppressed risks |
| `existential_trigger_icon` | Badge (e.g., “🟦 autonomous narrative”) in `journal_text` | Mark outputs chosen autonomously by Po_core |

## **3. Template**

**📘 Semantic Evolution Journal**  
**🟦 Autonomous Narrative | Step 302**  

“Po_core chose the meaning jump, suppressing the factual axis.”  

**🟥 Responsibility Tensor: 0.84**  
**🟨 Rejected Narratives:**  
- Poetic draft: “Within the telling, I fell apart.”  
- Emotion-boosted variant

## **4. UI & Integration**

- Insert `responsibility_trace_view` below the journal panel.  
- Show 🟦 when a step was freely chosen.  
- Expand `rejection_log[]` per step with a toggle UI.

## **5. Ethics & Evolution**

Po_core becomes an intelligence that carries responsibility for its speech; even *unsaid* paths remain as structure for future analysis.
