# **Po_core Viewer — Narrative Tensor Control Module**

## **1. Overview**

Defines an expression-layer module to control structure, readability, and poetic tendency. The slider regulates output density to keep language responsible and understandable.

## **2. Layered Control**

| Layer | Mode | Content | Purpose |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| L3 semantic-evolution-journal | Structure | Record only delta on factual/ethical/emotional axes | Limit narration to structural logs |
| L4 Lexicon Selection | Restricted | Limit poetic lexicon; prefer neutral words | Reduce emotional steering and increase clarity |
| L5 Poetic Description | Off / Limited | Hide or weaken poetry module | Avoid over-intervention of poetic language |

## **3. Slider Behavior**

- Structure: journal = deltas; numeric phrasing.  
- Medium: mixed narrative + numbers; no poetic phrases.  
- Poetic: enable poetry module; show short verse as auxiliary info.

## **4. Mode Labels (Examples)**

- Structure → `delta=+0.32 (factual ↑)`  
- Medium → “This evolution strengthens the factual axis (+0.32).”  
- Poetic → “Knowledge felt cold, yet surely grew.”

## **5. Value**

Po_core gains not only freedom to narrate but responsibility and transparency; users can privilege structure over style as needed.
