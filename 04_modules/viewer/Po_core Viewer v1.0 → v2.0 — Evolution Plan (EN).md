# **Po_core Viewer v1.0 → v2.0 — Evolution Plan**

## **1. Overview**

This plan evolves Po_core Viewer from a “result browser” into an engine that visualizes structure history, ethical interference, and human resonance pressure. The Viewer becomes not only a display, but an apparatus that *narrates*, *connects*, and *maintains responsiveness to the past*.

## **2. Three-Layer Viewer (Evolutional Functions)**

| Zone | Function | Tensors / Structures | Goal |
| :---- | :---- | :---- | :---- |
| 🧭 Operation-Pressure History | Heatmap of reason categories × time | `reason_confidence`, `user_feedback_level`, `category` | Understand human-intervention trends and value distributions |
| 🔗 Causal-Interference Zone | Network view of contextual influence between Po_trace steps | `contextual_influence_path`, `step_id`, `reason_code` | Make “meaning-interference causality” explicit |
| ⏳ Temporal Freshness Zone | Visualize decay of `reason_confidence` and delta of Po_self priority | `temporal_decay`, `confidence`, `priority_score` | Measure whether past judgments still matter |

## **3. Zone Details**

- Operation-Pressure: Reason-category × time × pressure (confidence × level) heatmap.
- Causal-Interference: Edges record `contextual_influence_path`—show why a step changed direction (e.g., R03 Insufficient Resonance on step `explanation_3`).
- Temporal Freshness: Cards show `reason_confidence` decay and the current delta in `priority_score`.

## **4. Functional Shift of the Viewer**

From v1.0 “parallel output checker” to v2.0 “map of ethical coevolution with humans”:
see → narrate; align → connect; record → reenact.
