# **Po_core — Advanced Governance: Structural Visualization Modules**

## **1. Overview**
Defines three high-level governance modules that multilayer-visualize evolution history from semantic, ethical, and resonance standpoints. They support structural validity and traceability of Po_trace via quality evaluation, risk detection, and recording of human decisions.

## **2. Modules & Effects**
| Proposal | Content | Expected Effect |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `jump_quality_index` + speech-domain & resonance trend | Record semantic domain of the jump and analyze Po_feedback trends afterward | Quantify social impact and evolution quality |
| `Po_trace_entropy_map` × ethics overlay | Cross-heatmap of entropy of meaning distribution and ethical interference | Visualize whether biased jumps carried ethical risk |
| `feedback_override_flag` + reason log | Log reasons when `Po_self.priority_score` is manually changed | Strengthen accountability and trace of human interventions |

## **3. Details**
- Record `semantic_domain` (e.g., emotion, politics, logic) at jump ignition.  
- Compute `jump_quality_index = semantic_delta / jump_length`.  
- Plot `Po_feedback.confidence` before/after (±3 steps).  
- Compute entropy from `impact_field_tensor` per step and overlay `W_eth` intensity.  
- Record `manual_override: true` with a reason log when GUI changes priority.

## **4. Integrated Operation & Significance**
Turns Po_trace from mere logging into a *three-layered structural evolution record* of meaning–ethics–resonance, usable as decision grounds for Viewer design, reconstruction strategies, and evolution audits.
