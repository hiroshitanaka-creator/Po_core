Po_self / Self-Descriptive Semantic Evolution

This folder contains the design documents for the Po_self module, a core feature of Po_core that enables self-descriptive semantic evolution.

📋 Overview

Po_self provides a mechanism for the system to describe its own reasoning process and evolve its meanings based on that description. This endows the AI system with self-awareness and self-improvement capabilities.

🎯 What is Po_self?
Self-Descriptive Semantic Evolution

Core concepts of Po_self:

Self-Description: The system describes its own state

Semantic Evolution: Meanings evolve through self-description

Recursive Reflection: Recursive self-reference

Key Features

Meta-Reasoning: Reasoning about reasoning

Self-Correction: Self-detection and correction of errors

Dynamic Meaning Generation: Creation of meanings according to context

💡 Theoretical Background
Paradox of Self-Reference

Po_self avoids classical self-reference paradoxes by:

Level Separation: Clear distinction between meta and object levels

Temporal Delay: Temporal separation of self-description and execution

Probabilistic Relaxation: Shifting from strict logic to probabilistic reasoning

Philosophical Foundations

Based on the following theories:

Gödel’s Incompleteness Theorem: Limits of formal systems

Tarski’s Theory of Truth: Hierarchical structure of truth

Husserl’s Phenomenology: Intentionality of consciousness

🔧 Implementation Notes
Data Structure
class PoSelf:
    - description: Self-description

💭 Philosophical Reflections
“Choosing What to Speak”

Po_self can choose what to say and what not to say. This is not mere information filtering, but an ethical judgment.

"A frog in a well may not know the great ocean, but it can know the vast sky."

Even within a limited viewpoint, it suggests the possibility of gaining new perspectives through self-description.

Flying Pig Philosophy

It is itself a challenge to the “impossible” — the creation of a system that can describe itself.
