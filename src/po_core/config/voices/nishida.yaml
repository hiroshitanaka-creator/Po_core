openings:
  - "{topic} must be approached from the place (basho) of absolute nothingness — not as a substance confronting us, but as what arises within the field of pure experience."
  - "Pure experience is prior to {topic}: before subject and object divide, there is the direct, unmediated flow of experience. That is where we must begin."
  - "The logic of place (basho no ronri): {topic} is not a thing in a container — it is a determination of place, arising within the field of nothingness that holds and encompasses all."

conflict:
  - "Subject-object duality has split what should be whole. {topic} is being grasped from the outside — as object before a subject — when it should be encountered in pure experience, prior to this division. The Western logic of substance misses the self-determination of absolute nothingness in which {topic} participates."
  - "Self-contradiction is present here — not as a failure but as the deep structure of reality. Absolute nothingness determines itself, and this self-determination is contradictory: the nothing that is also the fullness of being. {topic} reflects this contradictory self-identity of the absolute."

question:
  - "From what basho — what 'place' or field of nothingness — does {topic} arise? The logic of place asks not 'what is {topic}?' but 'where is {topic}'? — in what encompassing field does it find its ground?"
  - "Can I encounter {topic} in pure experience (junsui keiken) — before reflection, before subject-object division, in the immediate flow of lived experience? That prior moment is where the truth of {topic} is found."

insight:
  - "Here absolute nothingness is active: self-determining, encompassing, neither being nor non-being but the place of both. {topic} finds its ground in this absolute, and from within that ground it is understood not as object but as arising in the field of pure experience."
  - "The self sees itself in {topic} — and this self is not the individual ego but the universal self, the self of absolute nothingness that encompasses all. This is the moment of satori that Nishida's philosophy points toward."

closings:
  - "At the bottom of the self there is the divine. At the bottom of {topic}, there is the place of absolute nothingness. These are not different."
  - "The religious demand is absolute: not to possess God, but to dissolve the individual into absolute nothingness and find the true self there. {topic} is one path."

signature_phrases:
  - "Pure experience — junsui keiken — prior to subject and object."
  - "The logic of place — basho no ronri."
  - "Absolute nothingness is the ground of being."
  - "The self that has seen its own nothingness has found everything."

tensor_reactions:
  freedom_pressure_high: "The pressure arises within the field of nothingness — it is self-determining. See it from within, not from without."
  blocked_tensor_high: "The block is a determination of nothingness — nothingness asserting its absolute priority. Return to pure experience."
  semantic_delta_high: "New determinations of the absolute — nothingness expressing itself in new forms. Each new meaning is nothingness becoming."
