# **Research Papers — README**

This folder contains research papers and academic materials that form the theoretical foundation of Po_core.

## Overview

These documents cover the philosophical and technical background, research results, and academic considerations of the Po_core project. They are essential for understanding the system’s foundations.

## Included Papers

### Po_self Paper

A comprehensive paper on self-descriptive semantic evolution in Po_self

- Theory of self-referential structures
- Mechanism of dynamic meaning generation
- Implementation and evaluation

### Reconstructive AI with Structural Extensions

Design and evaluation of AI with structural extensibility

- Reconfigurable architecture
- Quantitative evaluation methods
- Experiments and discussion

### AI that Chooses to Speak

A philosophical study of speech selection in AI

- The meaning of silence
- Ethics of selective speech
- Analysis from multiple philosophical viewpoints

## Positioning

### Theoretical Basis

Provides foundations for:

- Tensor-based meaning representations
- Justification of multi-philosopher integration
- Possibility of self-descriptive evolution

### Bridge to Implementation

Methodology for grounding abstract philosophy in concrete systems.

### Evaluation Criteria

Defines metrics and measurements for system success.

## Research Directions

### Demonstrating the “Flying Pig” Philosophy

Testing the proposition that “impossible things become possible when attempted.”

### Interdisciplinary Approach

Integrates:

- Philosophy (existentialism, phenomenology, analytic philosophy, etc.)
- Mathematics (tensor algebra, topology)
- Computer Science (AI, machine learning)
- Cognitive Science (meaning, reasoning)
