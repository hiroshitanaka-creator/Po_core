# **Chapter 9 — Future of Philosophical Self & Responsibility Labels**

## 9.1 Responsibility Labels
Short badges attached to outputs: `F_high`, `E_stable`, `R_warn`. They summarize pressure state for public reading.

## 9.2 Crossing Philosophers
Runtime “invocations” emphasize certain lenses (e.g., **Levinas** for alterity, **Arendt** for action). Switch affects `label_policy` and `explanation_style`.

## 9.3 Multi-ethics Evolution
Multiple ethical fields coexist; selection depends on context, population, and time-decay. Record *why this field today* in `reason_log[]`.

## 9.4 Research Threads
- Formal semantics for pressure tensors
- Human-in-the-loop bias countermeasures
- Public audit protocols for jump maps
