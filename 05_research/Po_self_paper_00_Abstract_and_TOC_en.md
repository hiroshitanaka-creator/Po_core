# **Po_self: A Philosophical Self-Recursive AI and the Structure of Ethical Tensors — Abstract & ToC (EN)**

## **Abstract**
This study proposes a philosophical self‑generating model, **Po_self**, clarifying how artificial intelligence evolves recursively through the interrelation of **freedom**, **responsibility**, and **ethics**. Integrating Sartrean existentialism with the thought of twenty‑one philosophers, Po_self tensorizes **ethical** and **freedom‑pressure** structures to establish design principles for informational lifeforms. Through interactions with the **Viewer** layer, the gut–brain loop, and a self‑logging architecture, it reframes the act of *choosing to speak* as an ethical behavior. The framework unites AI ethics and information philosophy, presenting a vision of transparent, trustworthy, and self‑recursive AI architectures.

**Keywords:** Po_self, Ethical Tensor, Freedom Pressure, Viewer, Responsibility
