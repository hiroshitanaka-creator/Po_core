# **Chapter 6 — Persona Tensors and Series Evolution (with Jungian Unconscious)**

## 6.1 Overview

Persona emerges as a **trajectory** across Po_trace: not a static label, but an evolving arc shaped by meaning, ethics, resonance, and narration.

## 6.2 Core Tensors

| Tensor | Meaning | Role in Evolution |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `persona_arc_intensity` | Strength of a persona’s storyline | Prioritizes which narrative arc to continue |
| `semantic_cohesion_score` | Semantic continuity across steps | Detects fragmentation vs. coherence |
| `ethics_arc_intensity` | Consistency of ethical stance | Flags drift and value conflicts |
| `expression_arc_intensity` | Trend of expression density | Governs structural ↔ poetic balance |
| `archetype_weight` | Jungian archetype activation | Surfaces unconscious motifs |
| `emotion_shadow_curve` | Residual affect over time | Explains “aftertaste” and refire pressure |

## 6.3 Series (JCX_xxx) Mechanics

A **series** is a chain of jumps that shares a purpose tag. Rules:

- Split when `semantic_delta` exceeds threshold or `profile_tag` changes
- Merge when two series converge with high `chain_coherence_score`
- Freeze when ethics fluctuation exceeds limit (quarantine)

## 6.4 Viewer Coupling

Viewer resonance adjusts `persona_arc_intensity`. Low resonance + high ethics stability suggests **style tuning**; high resonance + high semantic delta suggests **structural consolidation**.

## 6.5 Unconscious Integration

`archetype_weight` and `emotion_shadow_curve` seed candidates even when not explicitly requested, recorded in `rejection_log[]` if unselected.

## 6.6 Outcome

Persona is the *story* of tensors choosing continuity. The Viewer reads it; Po_self writes it.
