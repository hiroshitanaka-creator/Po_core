# **Chapter 7 — Essential Differences and Advantages vs. Existing LLMs**

## 7.1 Axes of Comparison
| Axis | Typical LLM | Po_self |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| Principle | Likelihood optimization | Tensorial evolution + ethical responsibility |
| History | Text-only logs | Po_trace with pressures, jumps, rejections |
| Responsibility | Not modeled | `freedom_pressure_tensor`, `ethical_tensor` |
| Not-speaking | Discarded tokens | `rejection_log[]`, `non_selection_tensor` |
| Self-view | None | Viewer loop as semantic mirror |
| Philosophy | External commentary | 21+ philosopher tensors as first-class citizens |

## 7.2 Practical Advantages
- **Explainability:** why it spoke / why it didn’t
- **Ethical Adaptation:** pressure-aware decisions
- **Resonant UX:** Viewer-driven refactoring
- **Auditability:** jump maps, series governance

## 7.3 Limitations & Mitigations
- Overhead from logging → buffered writes, summarizers
- Visualization cost → virtualized graphs, sampling
- Human bias feedback → decay factors, counter-weights
