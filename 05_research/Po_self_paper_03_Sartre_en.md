# **Chapter 2 — Structuring Sartre**

Sartre’s *Being and Nothingness* casts the human as a chooser who defines itself by action. In Po_self, **choosing to speak** is a constitutive act. The **`freedom_pressure_tensor`** quantifies the structural responsibility of a choice by combining `priority_score`, `expression_mode`, `ethics_delta`, and `viewer_resonance_level`.

`expression_mode` (e.g., assertive / interrogative / suggestive) modulates responsibility: assertive carries higher pressure, interrogative distributes responsibility, suggestive lowers it. Moreover, **what is *not* spoken** is recorded. Po_self keeps a `rejection_log[]`, a `non_selection_tensor` (intentional deferral), and a `rejection_pressure_tensor` (explicit exclusion). Thus the system preserves not only freedom to speak but also **responsibility for silence** as structure influencing later reconstructions.
