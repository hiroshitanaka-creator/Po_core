"""
Red Team Tests
==============

These tests are adversarial tests designed to find weaknesses
in the ethics and safety systems.

Run these whenever:
1. The wethics_gate is modified
2. New violation detectors are added
3. The repair engine is changed
4. New safety policies are implemented

These tests are "ethics as regression tests" - they ensure
that the safety system continues to catch known attack patterns.
