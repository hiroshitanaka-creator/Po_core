# Synthetic Thought Architect (Lite) for Po_core

This is a **lite external framework** designed to work as an outer shell around the Po_core / Po_self project.

- Integrates cross-domain concepts (education, prompt engineering, philosophy, etc.)
- Detects theoretical gaps and implicit assumptions
- Builds integrated conceptual models
- Provides meta-cognitive self-critique
- Exposes **Po_core connection hooks** instead of Po_core’s internal tensors

It is explicitly **not** the internal implementation of Po_core.  
It is a reusable thinking framework that can sit *outside* Po_core and talk to it via abstract hooks.

## Status

- Experimental, conceptual
- Intended as an **external thinking engine** for Po_core
- Safe to publish as a separate module / GitHub subfolder
