# Po_core Commercial License

## Dual Licensing

Po_core is available under two licenses:

1. **GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 (AGPLv3)** — for open-source, non-commercial, and research use
2. **Commercial License** — for commercial use (see below)

---

## When Do You Need a Commercial License?

You need a commercial license if you:

- Integrate Po_core into a **proprietary/closed-source product**
- Offer Po_core (or a derivative) as a **paid SaaS service** without releasing source code under AGPLv3
- Use Po_core in a **commercial product or service** where AGPLv3 compliance is not feasible
- Wish to use Po_core without the **copyleft obligations** of AGPLv3

You do **NOT** need a commercial license if you:

- Use Po_core for **personal, academic, or research purposes**
- Build an **open-source project** that complies with AGPLv3
- Evaluate Po_core internally without distributing or offering it as a service

---

## Commercial License Terms (Summary)

A commercial license grants you:

- The right to use, modify, and distribute Po_core in proprietary software
- Freedom from AGPLv3 copyleft obligations
- No requirement to disclose your source code
- Use in SaaS or network services without triggering the AGPL network clause

Pricing and terms are negotiated individually based on use case and scale.
