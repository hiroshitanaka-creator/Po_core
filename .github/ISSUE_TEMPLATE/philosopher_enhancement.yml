        ## When Pigs Fly Through Philosophy 🐷🎈

        This template is for enhancing philosophical reasoning modules—the **core soul** of Po_core.

        **Flying Pig Philosophy:**
        - 💡 **Hypothesize Boldly** — Dare to formalize the impossible
        - 🔬 **Verify Rigorously** — Philosophical scrutiny + empirical validation
        - 🌱 **Revise Gracefully** — Publish failures as learning signals

        > *"A frog in a well may not know the ocean, but it can know the sky."*

      description: Explain the philosophical concept or theory
      placeholder: |
        Describe the philosophical foundation of this enhancement.

        Example:
        "Heidegger's concept of 'Being-toward-death' (Sein-zum-Tode) emphasizes authentic existence by confronting mortality. This creates a 'care structure' (Sorge) that reveals the weight of responsibility in decision-making..."

      label: Implementation Idea
      description: How should this be implemented in code?
      placeholder: |
        Describe your implementation approach.

        Example:
        "Implement a 'mortality_awareness' function that:
        1. Analyzes the temporal horizon of decisions
        2. Calculates 'care weight' based on finitude
        3. Feeds into Freedom Pressure tensor (F_P) as existential weight
        4. Interacts with Sartre's 'radical freedom' for balanced tension"

      label: Expected Impact
      description: How will this affect Po_core's reasoning?
      placeholder: |
        Describe the expected impact on tensors, reasoning quality, or system behavior.

        Example:
        - **Freedom Pressure (F_P):** +15-30% increase in ethical weight for life-critical decisions
        - **Semantic Profile (Δs):** Enhanced temporal awareness in meaning evolution
        - **Blocked Tensor (B):** Better capture of 'what remains unsaid' about mortality
        - **Reasoning Quality:** More authentic, responsibility-aware responses

      description: How does this embody "hypothesize boldly, verify rigorously, revise gracefully"?
      placeholder: |
        Connect this enhancement to Flying Pig Philosophy.

        Example:
        **Hypothesize Boldly:**
        - Formalize 'Being-toward-death' as a computable tensor

        **Verify Rigorously:**
        - Test against philosophical edge cases
        - Validate with existentialist literature
        - Measure impact on decision quality

        **Revise Gracefully:**
        - Document failures (e.g., over-nihilistic outputs)
        - Iterate based on philosophical coherence
