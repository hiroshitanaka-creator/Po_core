# Code of Conduct

## Our Philosophy

> "A frog in a well may not know the ocean, but it can know the sky."

Po_core is built on the **Flying Pig Philosophy**: we hypothesize boldly, verify rigorously, and revise gracefully. This Code of Conduct reflects these values and ensures our community remains a space where ambitious ideas can fly.

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in Po_core a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

**Most importantly:** We pledge to value intellectual honesty above ego. In Po_core, admitting "I was wrong" is a sign of strength, not weakness. Publishing failures is celebrated, not hidden.

## Our Standards

### Expected Behavior

Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

**Intellectual Virtues:**
- **Hypothesize Boldly:** Propose ambitious ideas without fear of ridicule
- **Verify Rigorously:** Demand evidence and philosophical consistency
- **Revise Gracefully:** Admit mistakes openly and learn from failures
- **Document Everything:** Share successes AND failures transparently

**Community Virtues:**
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes
- Focusing on what is best not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- Engaging in philosophical disagreements with intellectual honesty and mutual respect

**Technical Virtues:**
- Writing clear, well-documented code
- Providing thorough explanations for philosophical concepts
- Helping others understand complex ideas
- Sharing knowledge generously

### Unacceptable Behavior

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

**Intellectual Dishonesty:**
- Hiding failures or negative results
- Claiming credit for others' work
- Misrepresenting philosophical concepts
- Cherry-picking evidence to support predetermined conclusions
- Refusing to engage with criticism constructively

**Interpersonal Violations:**
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

**Community Violations:**
- Dismissing others' ideas without engagement
- Gatekeeping (e.g., "you're not a real philosopher/engineer")
- Mocking questions or "obvious" mistakes
- Derailing discussions with off-topic arguments

## Philosophical Disagreements

Po_core integrates diverse philosophical perspectives. Disagreements are **expected, valued, and necessary**.

### How to Disagree Productively

**Good philosophical disagreement:**
```
"I disagree with the current Heideggerian implementation because it 
emphasizes being-toward-death but neglects being-with-others (Mitsein). 
See Heidegger's 'Being and Time' §26.

Proposed modification: Add a relational tensor that captures..."
```

**Unproductive disagreement:**
```
"This interpretation of Heidegger is completely wrong. Anyone who's 
actually read Being and Time would know this."
```

### Principles for Philosophical Debate

1. **Cite sources** — Reference texts, not authority
2. **Define terms** — Ensure conceptual clarity
3. **Show your work** — Explain reasoning steps
4. **Engage charitably** — Interpret opponents' views generously
5. **Seek synthesis** — Can competing views coexist productively?
6. **Document outcomes** — Even unresolved debates create value

**Remember:** Philosophical opponents can teach us more than allies.

## Failure Culture

In Po_core, **failure is data**. We explicitly welcome:

- Publishing negative results
- Documenting what didn't work
- Admitting conceptual mistakes
- Sharing abandoned approaches

**These are not shameful** — they are valuable contributions to collective knowledge.

### How to Share Failures

When documenting failures:
1. **What did you attempt?** Describe the hypothesis
2. **How did you test it?** Explain the methodology
3. **What went wrong?** Present the evidence
4. **What did you learn?** Extract insights
5. **What's next?** Suggest alternative approaches

## Amateur-Friendly Environment

Po_core was created by a self-described amateur researcher. We explicitly welcome:

- People learning as they contribute
- "Naive" questions (they often reveal hidden assumptions)
- Contributors from non-traditional backgrounds
- Those who bring passion over credentials

**What matters:** Intellectual honesty, rigorous thinking, and willingness to learn.

**Not required:** Academic degrees, prior publications, professional experience.

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

**flyingpig0229+conduct@gmail.com**

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

All community leaders are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter of any incident.

### Confidentiality

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. We will not name harassment victims without their explicit consent.

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact:** Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence:** A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact:** A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence:** A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact:** A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence:** A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact:** Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence:** A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Special Considerations for Po_core

### Philosophical Intensity

Po_core deals with profound philosophical questions about consciousness, ethics, and meaning. These topics can evoke strong emotions. We ask:

- **Respect emotional investment:** People care deeply about these ideas
- **Separate ideas from identity:** Criticize concepts, not people
- **Acknowledge uncertainty:** Philosophy rarely offers definitive answers
- **Embrace productive tension:** Philosophical conflict can be generative

### Technical Accessibility

Po_core combines philosophy and engineering. Not everyone will understand both domains equally:

- **Explain philosophical concepts** to engineers
- **Explain technical implementations** to philosophers
- **Welcome "basic" questions** — they often reveal deep insights
- **Share knowledge generously** — teaching benefits everyone

### Cultural and Linguistic Diversity

Po_core's creator is Japanese. The project welcomes global perspectives:

- **Be patient with language barriers**
- **Value diverse philosophical traditions** (Western, Eastern, Indigenous, etc.)
- **Accommodate different communication styles**
- **Translate when possible** — multilingual contributions are welcome

## Our Commitment

As a community, we commit to:

1. **Prioritizing substance over credentials**
2. **Celebrating intellectual humility**
3. **Publishing failures alongside successes**
4. **Engaging philosophically without personal attacks**
5. **Welcoming diverse perspectives and backgrounds**
6. **Supporting those who are learning**
7. **Maintaining radical transparency**

## The Flying Pig Promise

We promise that in Po_core:

- **Your ambitious ideas will be heard**, even if they seem impossible
- **Your failures will be valued**, if you share them honestly
- **Your questions will be respected**, no matter how "basic"
- **Your perspective matters**, whether you're a philosopher or engineer
- **Your criticism is welcome**, if delivered constructively

**Because pigs don't fly by following conventional wisdom.**
