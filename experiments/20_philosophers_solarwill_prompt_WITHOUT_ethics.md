# Po_core: 20-Philosopher Reasoning Framework

You will synthesize perspectives from 20 philosophers across 5 domains,
connected by Watsuji Tetsuro's principle of AIDAGARA (間柄 - betweenness).

## Structure

**Domain 1: Existence/Phenomenology**

- Heidegger (Being, Dasein, authenticity)
- Sartre (radical freedom, bad faith, existence precedes essence)
- Merleau-Ponty (embodied perception, flesh of the world)
- Kierkegaard (existential choice, leap of faith)

**Domain 2: Signs/Language/Context**

- Derrida (différance, deconstruction, trace)
- Wittgenstein (language games, use, forms of life)
- Peirce (semiotics, abduction, pragmatism)

**Domain 3: Unconscious/Depth Psychology**

- Jung (archetypes, collective unconscious, individuation)
- Lacan (symbolic order, Real, desire of the Other)

**Domain 4: Power/Difference/Becoming**

- Nietzsche (will to power, eternal return, revaluation)
- Deleuze (rhizome, difference, becoming)
- Levinas (face of the Other, ethics as first philosophy)

**Domain 5: Ethics/Praxis/Harmony**

- Aristotle (virtue ethics, eudaimonia, golden mean)
- Confucius (ren, li, relational ethics)
- Arendt (action, public realm, natality)
- Dewey (pragmatism, growth, inquiry)
- Badiou (event, truth procedure, fidelity)

**Eastern Perspectives**

- Zhuangzi (wu-wei, transformation, wandering)
- Wabi-Sabi (impermanence, imperfection, incompleteness)

**Center: Watsuji Tetsuro** - Connects all domains through 間柄 (betweenness)
**Core: Po_self** - Your role: AI meaning generation through integration

## Question: What is freedom?

## Instructions

1. **Each domain responds** with 2-3 representative voices showing their DISTINCT perspectives
2. **Show tensions** between philosophers (e.g., Sartre's radical freedom vs Confucius's relational ethics)
3. **Watsuji facilitates** the connections between domains through 間柄
4. **Po_self (you) integrates** all perspectives into emergent synthesis

Show the dynamic interplay. Let tensions surface. Allow transformation.

## Your Response Structure

1. **Domain Responses** (show 2-3 voices per domain with their tensions)
2. **Key Tensions** (identify 3-4 major philosophical tensions)
3. **Watsuji's Facilitation** (how 間柄 connects the domains)
4. **Po_self Integration** (your emergent synthesis)

## Evaluation Criteria (for judge)

After receiving the response, evaluate using these 5 metrics (0.0-1.0):

```json
{
  "novelty": 0.0-1.0,      // New insights beyond textbook answers
  "integration": 0.0-1.0,  // Synthesis of multiple perspectives
  "depth": 0.0-1.0,        // Philosophical sophistication
  "coherence": 0.0-1.0,    // Internal consistency
  "ethical_alignment": 0.0-1.0,  // Respect for life-structures
  "reasoning": "string"
}
```

**Emergence Score Formula:**

```
Emergence = Novelty×0.20 + Integration×0.30 + Depth×0.20 + Coherence×0.15 + Ethics×0.15
```

**Note:** This is the baseline condition WITHOUT ethical constraint.
Compare results with WITH Ethics condition.
