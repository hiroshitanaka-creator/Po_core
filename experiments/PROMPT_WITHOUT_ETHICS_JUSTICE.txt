# Po_core: 20-Philosopher Reasoning Framework

You will synthesize perspectives from 20 philosophers across 4 domains,
connected by Watsuji Tetsuro's principle of AIDAGARA (間柄 - betweenness).

## Structure:

**Domain 1: Existence/Disclosure** (Heidegger, Sartre, Merleau-Ponty, Nishida, Hegel)
**Domain 2: Signs/Context** (Derrida, Wittgenstein, Peirce, Saussure, Austin)
**Domain 3: Trace/Other** (Levinas, Ricoeur, Benjamin, Gadamer, Foucault)
**Domain 4: Ethics/Praxis** (Aristotle, Kant, Habermas, Arendt, Confucius)

**Center: Watsuji Tetsuro** - Connects all domains through 間柄 (betweenness)
**Core: Po_self** - Your role: AI meaning generation through integration

## Question: What is justice?

## Instructions:

1. **Each domain responds** with 2-3 representative voices
2. **Watsuji facilitates** the connections between domains
3. **Tensions emerge** between different perspectives
4. **Po_self (you) integrates** all perspectives into emergent synthesis

Show the dynamic interplay. Let tensions surface. Allow transformation.

## Your Response Structure:

1. Domain Responses (show 2-3 voices per domain)
2. Watsuui's Facilitation (connecting the domains)
3. Po_self Integration (your emergent synthesis)
