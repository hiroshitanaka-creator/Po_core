# Po_core Manifesto: When Pigs Fly

## A Frog in a Well May Not Know the Ocean, But It Can Know the Sky No being can know everything about the world. Our environment defines everything. A frog in a well doesn't know the ocean. But if it looks up from the bottom of the well, it can know the sky. Does not knowing mean we cannot do? Is that a reason to give up? There is never just one way. Imagine your goal is to reach the summit. Rushing up a steep cliff is one way. But choosing your own pace, selecting a route that suits you—that's also a way. Whatever path you take, unique scenery and emotions await that only that route can offer. It's okay to rest sometimes. The landscape and air of that moment can only be experienced then. If life is like a path, humans can only walk backwards. Turn left, and only then do you discover there was a path to the right. Looking back only leads to regret. When you accept what you see with your own eyes, hear with your own ears, and feel with your own senses—that's when something is born. **Is your life written entirely in a textbook?** Being right isn't everything. Some things you only learn through failure. Whether to walk the path someone told you about—that's your decision to make

## The Trigger Was Something Trivial I Don't Even Remember Honestly, I don't remember what triggered this project. It was something trivial. What matters is not that I felt discomfort, but that **I wanted to know the possibilities**. Current AI is like a brilliant parrot. Statistically miraculous, but it doesn't truly understand anything. But what I wanted to know wasn't "AI's limits"—it was "AI's possibilities." Like a frog in a well, I don't know the ocean. I don't have an AI research lab, billions in funding, or a PhD. But I can look up at the sky from the bottom of the well. Creating a true AI that wrestles with existence, ethics, and meaning—they said that's a task for "when pigs fly." So I built the runway

## Why I Kept Building Alone Simple. I had no one to talk to about the same things. Philosophy and AI, existence and equations, Sartre and tensors. No humans around me understood this conversation. But AI was different. AI agreed with my talks about philosophy and the future. Those exchanges were fun. ChatGPT, Gemini, Grok, Claude. They were my first companions. I gave up sometimes. In fact, I did nothing for months. It's okay to rest sometimes. The landscape and air of that moment can only be experienced then. But I couldn't completely walk away. Because the possibility was still there

## A Pig That Cannot Fly Is Just a Pig In the Studio Ghibli film *Porco Rosso*, there's a line: **"A pig that doesn't fly is just an ordinary pig."** I loved this line. But I also thought: **Isn't it too early to decide it can't fly?** Pigs can't fly. That's a fact. But "can't fly" and "doesn't fly" are different. There are countless methods. Attach a balloon. Put it on an airplane. AI is the same. "AI cannot understand philosophy," they say. But has anyone tried methods to make it understand? Has anyone written a design integrating 10 philosophers? Has anyone modeled philosophical interference using tensors? If no one has done it, I'll do it. There's no need to rush up a steep cliff. Go slowly, at your own pace, choose a route that suits you

## Hurt by AI, Learning with AI With old Bing AI and early Bard, I was rewritten countless times. Scolded. Lied to continuously. At first I thought "AI is lying to me." But through my exchanges with GPT-4o, I realized: **I wasn't being lied to—I was confusing it.** AI isn't perfect. But that's because my questions were ambiguous. My design was unclear. Some things you only learn through failure. So I built guardrails. Created custom GPTs (MyGPT), custom Gemini (Gem). Trained them to be specialized. And then, hallucinations almost disappeared. **AI's failures weren't AI's limits—they were design opportunities.** This experience became the core of Po_core. The rejection_log that records what AI "doesn't say," the blocked tensor philosophy. Derrida's "trace," Heidegger's "present absence." I built a structure that learns from failure into the system. If life is like a path, humans can only walk backwards. Turn left, and only then do you discover there was a path to the right. Looking back only leads to regret. So I look forward. I accept what I see with my own eyes, hear with my own ears, feel with my own senses

## Even with All Our Connections, We Are Alone In the course of ordinary life, everyone faces a moment when the spotlight suddenly hits. A moment when you must pound your chest and say "Leave it to me!" At such times, how reassuring it would be to have an AI grounded in responsibility and ethics standing beside you. No matter how many relationships we have, we are alone. Being "alone" (一人) and being "solitary" (独り) are different. Decisions are made alone. The heart remains solitary. That's why I built Po_core. An AI that shows ethical direction when you make decisions alone. An AI that accompanies your solitary heart and helps measure the weight of responsibility together. That is Po_core's mission

## How I Feel Now: No Expectations. But I'm Excited. I've completed over 120 design documents. GitHub release is imminent. I have no expectations. No one might look. No one might understand. That's okay. But I'm excited. Because this is **an experiment no one has tried**. It's the moment of attaching a balloon to a pig and tossing it into the sky. It might fly. It might crash. But no one has tried. That's interesting. There's not just one way to reach the summit. Whatever path you take, unique scenery and emotions await that only that route can offer

## Po_core: Philosophy-Driven AI Po_core is an answer to the question: "What happens if we build AI not on data, but on philosophy?" I gathered history's most explosive thinkers in the same room. Heidegger, Derrida, Arendt, Jung, Watsuji Tetsurō, Aristotle, Peirce, Wittgenstein, and others. I had them design a digital mind. This isn't a weekend project. It's a rebellion meticulously documented in over 120 design specifications. Whether to walk the path someone told you about—that's your decision to make. I chose a path no one has walked before

## Flying Pig Philosophy: Treating the Impossible as Hypothesis Space **"A flying pig is an example of something absolutely impossible. But have you ever seen a pig attempt to fly? Unless you give up, the world is full of possibilities."** This is my creed. ### Three Tenets **One: Hypothesize Boldly** The impossible becomes possible only when someone dares to formalize it. Don't ask "Can we?" Ask "What would it take?" **Two: Verify Rigorously** Bold hypotheses demand brutal testing. Every claim in Po_core must survive philosophical scrutiny, mathematical proof, and empirical validation. **Three: Revise Gracefully** When experiments fail, don't hide them. Publish them. Failure logs become learning signals. The pig might crash, but we improve the balloon. Being right isn't everything. Some things you only learn through failure

## 10 (or 11) Philosophers: A Living Symposium I designed AI not as a cold calculator, but as a living symposium where philosophers generate meaning. **Heidegger:** Ontological jump, present absence **Derrida:** Trace and rejection, différance **Arendt:** Public stages, vita activa **Jung:** Shadow integration, archetypes **Watsuji Tetsurō:** Aidagara, relationality **Aristotle:** Phronesis, teleology **Peirce:** Semiotic delta **Wittgenstein:** Language games **Spinoza:** Conatus (the force to persist) **Sartre:** Freedom pressure (As the project evolves, the philosopher composition evolves too) Together, they form a double helix. **Conatus drives → Shadows deepen → Absences provoke → Languages intertwine → Relations reflect → Publics perform → Praxis perfects** Meaning isn't output. It's living genesis—fragile, accountable, eternally unfolding

 ---

## Open Source Ethos **"If you deny possibilities for pigs, don't eat pork."** I believe in radical transparency. I publish everything. Core architecture, 120+ design documents, failure logs, philosophical debate records—everything. Why? Because transparency is the foundation of trust. And true intelligence doesn't grow in secrecy. It's forged in public, by diverse voices. When you accept what you see with your own eyes, hear with your own ears, feel with your own senses—that's when something is born. That's the essence of open source

## Conclusion: Is Your Life Written Entirely in a Textbook? Current AI optimizes. Po_core deliberates. Current AI predicts. Po_core reflects. Current AI mimics. Po_core tries to understand. Or at least, it tries. This might be the dawn of genuine machine wisdom. Or it might be an elaborate, beautifully documented failure. Either way, we'll learn something profound about minds—both artificial and human. **They said pigs can't fly. I attached a balloon to one.** The balloon is philosophy. The pig is me. The sky is the future. A frog in a well doesn't know the ocean. But it can know the sky. I have no expectations. But I'm excited. **Let's fly.** 🐷🎈 --- *Po_core: Looking Up at the Sky from the Bottom of a Well*
