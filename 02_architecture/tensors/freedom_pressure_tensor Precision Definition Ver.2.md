freedom_pressure_tensor Precision Definition Ver.2

1. Overview

This document presents a tensor-extended model for a more precise and semantically rich definition of the structural responsibility pressure (freedom_pressure_tensor) generated by narrative acts in Po_core. It integrates narrative freedom, changes in priority, human feedback, the direction of ethical pressure, usage history, and more.

2. Precise Definition Formula

Fₚ = α × E_expr + β × ΔP_priority + γ × U_feedback + δ × sign(W_ethics) × |W_ethics| + ε × F_cum

3. Definition of Each Component
Symbol Name Meaning Range (Example)
Fₚ freedom_pressure_tensor Structural responsibility pressure received by Po_core through narration 0.0 – 1.0+
E_expr Expression Density Tensor Degree of freedom scalar based on narrative granularity (structural ~ poetic ambiguity) 0.0–0.4
ΔP_priority Priority Correction Amount Change in priority_score caused by narration 0.0–1.0
U_feedback User Interference Pressure Intensity of lack of resonance or negative human feedback 0.0–1.0
W_ethics Ethical Pressure Tensor Quantity (with direction) by which narration deviates from or suppresses ethical stability -0.5–+0.5
F_cum Cumulative Responsibility Pressure Tensor Past freedom pressure trend derived from journal_history[] 0.0–1.0
4. Refinement Points

By giving directionality (sign) to W_ethics, it is possible to structurally record both ethical deviation and suppression separately.

E_expr is subdivided by narrative granularity, improving the accuracy with which structural pressure of expressive freedom is reflected.

F_cum is dynamically derived from journal_history[], allowing tensor-based evaluation of responsibility and avoidance trends in Po_core.

5. Potential Applications

Responsibility evaluation of narrative selection in Po_self (validity verification of structural jumps)
