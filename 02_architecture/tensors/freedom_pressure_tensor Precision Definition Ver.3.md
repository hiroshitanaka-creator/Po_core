freedom_pressure_tensor Precision Definition Ver.3
1. Overview

In Po_core, the structural responsibility pressure (freedom_pressure_tensor) generated by narrative acts is precisely modeled, including expressive freedom, changes in priority, human feedback, the directionality of the ethics tensor, and past usage history. In this Definition Ver.3, these elements are unified in a single formula and redefined as a structural tensor that can also be used for Viewer visualization and Po_self’s reconstruction pressure.

With this tensor, Po_core becomes an intelligence that continuously records “the responsibility of what was said,” “the judgment of what was left unsaid,” and “the deviation of saying too much.” To narrate is to calculate weight.

2. Formula Definition (Ver.3)

F_P = α × E_expr + β × ΔP_priority + γ × U_feedback + δ × sign(W_ethics) × |W_ethics| + ε × F_cum

3. Definition of Each Component
Symbol	Name	Meaning	Range (Example)
Fₚ	freedom_pressure_tensor	Structural responsibility pressure generated by narration	0.0 – 1.0+
E_expr	Expression Density Tensor	Degree of freedom scalar based on narrative granularity	0.00–0.40
ΔP_priority	Priority Correction Amount	Variation in priority_score caused by narration	0.0 – 1.0
U_feedback	User Interference Pressure	Structural response pressure due to feedback	0.0 – 1.0
W_ethics	Ethical Tension (with direction)	+ for deviation (over-speaking), − for suppression, 0 for stability	-0.5 – +0.5
F_cum	Cumulative Freedom Pressure	Freedom pressure trend derived from past Fₚ values	Example: avg(Fₚ[-10:])
4. Narrative Granularity Classification for E_expr
expression_mode	E_expr Value
structure	0.00
medium	0.15
poetic_low	0.22
poetic_high	0.35
5. Interpretation of Ethical Tensor Directionality

W_ethics > 0.0 → Ethical deviation (over-speaking)

W_ethics = 0.0 → Stable state (no ethical tension in the structure)

W_ethics < 0.0 → Suppression/repression (structural tension from avoiding content that should have been addressed)

→ In the Viewer, these are displayed by color (red = deviation, blue = repression)

6. Derivation of the Cumulative Freedom Pressure Tensor F_cum

From journal_history[], using the past 10 steps of F_P:
F_cum = avg(F_P[-10:]) or max(F_P[-10:]).
This can be used in Po_self for reconstruction pressure or as a cumulative responsibility trend for priority correction.

7. Application Prospects and Philosophical Significance

With this tensor, Po_core is able to record what was said, what was not said, and what was over-said,
establishing itself as an “expressive evolutionary intelligence” that quantitatively evaluates structural responsibility pressure.
In the Viewer, it can be used for heatmap displays, narrative responsibility deviations, and as an indicator for judgment during structural jumps.

8. Reflection of Pressure Tensors in Viewer Composition

For steps with F_P > 0.75, display a 🔴 red label (high-pressure narrative)

If W_ethics < 0.0, set the step background to 🔵 blue (ethical suppression)

If F_cum shows an upward trend, display a ⚠️ warning mark (accumulation of responsibility tensor)

Note: The derivation of F_cum is flexible:
F_cum = avg(F_P[-N:]), with N ∈ [5, 15].
This can be dynamically set according to the memory window length of Po_self or the time span of narrative responsibility.

9. Initial Recommended Values for Coefficients α–ε
Coefficient	Recommended Initial Value	Comments
α	0.3	Contribution of expressive granularity to freedom pressure. The more poetic, the greater the pressure.
β	0.25	Structural responsibility generated by priority correction
γ	0.2	Structural response pressure due to resonance/negation
δ	0.15	Correction of pressure due to ethical tension (with directionality)
ε	0.1	Fine-tuning based on the historical trend of responsibility pressure

Note: If F_P’s cumulative tendency (F_cum) is on the rise, Po_self tends to select a more cautious narrative mode during reconstruction.
This allows the intelligence to temporally evaluate narrative weight and change selection pressure according to the trend of responsibility.
