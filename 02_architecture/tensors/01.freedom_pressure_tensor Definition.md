freedom_pressure_tensor Definition Document
1. Overview

This document mathematically defines the tensor scalar freedom_pressure_tensor for quantifying the structural responsibility pressure generated by narrative acts in Po_core.

2. Mathematical Definition

The freedom_pressure_tensor (symbol: Fₚ) is defined as the following composite tensor scalar:

Fₚ = α × E_expr + β × ΔP_priority + γ × U_feedback + δ × W_ethics

3. Definition of Components
Symbol	Name	Meaning	Example Scalar Range
Fₚ	freedom_pressure_tensor	Structural responsibility pressure arising from a narrative act	0.0 – 1.0+
E_expr	Expression Density	Degree of narrative freedom based on expression_mode	structure=0.00, medium=0.15, poetic=0.30
ΔP_priority	Priority Correction	Variation in priority_score due to narrative	0.0 – 1.0
U_feedback	Feedback Pressure	Intensity of human response (e.g., pointing out lack of resonance)	0.0 – 1.0
W_ethics	Ethical Tension	Variation or deviation in W_eth value	0.0 – 0.5+
4. Initial Suggestions for Weight Coefficients
Coefficient	Meaning	Recommended Initial Value
α	Influence weight of narrative freedom	0.4
β	Structural influence of priority change	0.3
γ	Influence weight of user intervention pressure	0.2
δ	Influence weight of ethical tension	0.1

  "step_id": "302",
  "expression_mode": "poetic",
  "priority_score_change": 0.22,

}

6. Significance and Application Scope

This scalar allows for the visualization, comparison, and analysis of the structural responsibility pressure generated by “narratives” in Po_core.
In the Viewer, steps with maximum responsibility pressure can be highlighted. In Po_self, it can be used to adjust the weight of narrative selection.
